Iron Man possesses a wealth of powers through his powered armor suit. These powers include super strength, the ability to fly, durability, and a number of weapons. The primary weapons used by Iron Man are rays that are shot from the palms of his gauntlets.
Iron Man gets his superpowers from his metallic suit of armor and other technologies invented by his alter ego Tony Stark. Tony is a genius engineer and wealthy owner of a technology company. Tony built the Iron Man suit when he was kidnapped and suffered an injury to his heart. The suit was meant to save his life and help him escape. 
Tony also has an improved artificial nervous system which gives him greater healing powers, super perception, and the ability to merge with his suit of armor. Outside of his armor he has been trained in hand-to-hand combat.
